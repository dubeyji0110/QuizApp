# Getting Started with QUIZ APP

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).\
QUIZ App developed by [Devansh Dubey](https://github.com/dubyeji0110) using ReactJS and deployed on Netlify.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start` or `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build` or `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
